# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Introduction

Utilizing Bootstrap, I built a responsive website that will be home to my portfolio of projects that I make during my time at UW Coding Boot Camp. My website consists of an About Me page, a Portfolio page to house my projects, and a Contact Page. While my Portfolio Page only holds placeholder images at this time, they will eventually be linked to the projects that I complete.

Building this website taught me so much about working with CSS frameworks, building resposive webpages, media queries, page layout, and Bootstrap grid. I learned that the beauty of frameworks is that they already have built in UI features and mobile responsiveness. But I also learned that in order to use frameworks most effectively, and really make a webpage your own, you really have to understand how that framework works in order to manipulate it. This comes in to play when you are styling the page using your own CSS, it's important to know what styles you can and can't change in order to keep the framework functioning as it should. For this same reason it is important to understand how Bootstrap's responsive grid system works so that you are able to work within it and get your page layout looking exactly how you want it.

<!-- 
This homework assignment required us to build a responsive webpage to show our portfolio of projects that we are going to be making in this class. The assignemnt was to have three different pages (about me, portfolio, and contact), and to make it look as close to the images provided as possible. In order to make our webpage responsive we had to make sure that our page looked good on any size device or screen width.

We used the CSS framework Bootstrap to style and layout our page, and added our own CSS style sheet to make small adjustments. We learned that the beaufy of frameworks is that they have already built in UI features and mobile reponsiveness. This assignment taught me alot about page layout, working with frameworks, Bootstrap grid, google-fu, and responsive web design.  -->
