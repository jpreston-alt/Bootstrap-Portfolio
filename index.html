                                Hi! Welcome to my first website, I'm pretty stoked about it. My name's Joanna and I was born in
                                Nevada, raised in Oregon, and have been living in Seattle for the past 8 years. I moved up here to
                                attend school at the University of Washington and never left because it's the best, and you can ride
                                your bike to work year round!
                                <br><br>
                                After graduating from UW I got a job with Urban Outfitters as a Display Artist designing fixtures
                                and displays. I currently oversee the design of our four Seattle area stores, and I spend my days
                                designing and building. My career in design has taught me how to learn quickly, creatively solve
                                problems, and to enjoy doing so! It's this love of problem solving, and a lifelong interest in how
                                things work, that got me interested in a career in web development. I've always loved making things,
                                and the idea of learning to make in a whole new medium is so exciting to me.
                                <br><br>
                                Outside of work and class I love to ride my bike, cook, read, craft, and chill with the coolest dog
                                in the world: Bug. Other obsessions include Stuff You Should Know, coffee, Queen, How I Met Your
                                Mother, and now coding. I'm very excited about this class and about learning all the things!
